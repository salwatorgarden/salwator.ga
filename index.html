                    <h2>About</h2>
                    <p>In the summer of 2019, we joined a wonderful initiative in Stary Salwator, near the Kościuszko Mound. Together with a group of city gardeners, we created a quiet permaculture place there. Goals: healthy work with the land, a bit of exercise, planting and picking fruit, vegetables, herbs, resting, hammocking, reading books, educational and artistic meetings.

Plot no. 126102_9.0013.133, belonging to the Municipality of Krakow, was made available by the City Greenery Board to an informal group of activists and gardeners. The initiative is apolitical and not related to any religion or any challenge group.

We do not apply detailed regulations here, on the contrary - the rules of coexistence are developed by themselves, without writing, as this space develops. The entrance to the Garden is open, we do not intend to fence in with the gate. Guest, if you go there, take a rest and take advantage of its beauty. If you see plants that need water - water them with water from the tank. If something has fallen or needs help - help or pick up. Make this place your own.

Nausika deals with the financing of the current activity of the Garden and small construction investments in its area. We managed to obtain funds from the European Union, and more specifically from the European Solidarity Corps - PROJECT SALWATOR REGENERACJA - and from the City of Krakow - under the so-called Local Initiative, implemented by the Nicolaus Copernicus University, Department of Social Policy and Health.
